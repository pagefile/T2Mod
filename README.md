# T2Mod
 
Something I uploaded for no other reason to share from my early Tribes 2 modding days. If you want to actually install and try to run/modify the mod, you can download the game installer [here](https://www.tribesnext.com/) (Don't worry, it's freeware! It's been that way since just before Tribes: Vengeance's launch)

Don't install it to Program Files or Program Files (x86) or you'll need to run the game as admin to be sure the mod loads properly

After installing the game you'll need to put the T2Mod folder inside the GameData folder of the Tribes 2 game folder. Something like this

>Tribes2\GameData\T2Mod

To run, you need to copy one of the Tribes 2 shortcuts (either the LAN or online one) and add a paramater to the target: -mod T2Mod. That will run the game with T2Mod scripts loaded. Any scripts not in the folder (basically everything besides weapon.cs and inventoryHud.cs) gets compiled from the base game archive.
